The issues reported were related to failures with service management operations and connectivity or availability of services. Most of the users were not able to access apps like OneNote, OneDrive, Defender, SharePoint, Windows 365, Teams, etc. Though some of these apps are now back online.\nReportedly, companies in Australia were the first to report the error after several broadcasters and banks were unable to access their Windows machines. Most of them were shown the blue screen of death (BSOD), a window that appears when a system fails to boot properly. By the time European nations embarked on their workday, it was reported that this had become a global problem impacting several industries across the globe.",
