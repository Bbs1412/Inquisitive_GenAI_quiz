# `Inquisitive` Generative-AI Powered Quiz Generator

<!-- <hr> -->

This repository contains the content of <u>Inquisitive:</u> generative intelligence powered quiz generator.

## Description
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The project is AI-driven multilingual question generator which creates quizzes from any text/news articles in any language.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The project incorporates language detection, machine translation, and a large language model (LLM) for accurate and contextually relevant quiz generation.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It utilizes the Gemini-API to create quizzes based on the given text context. In cases where the user inputs a topic instead of a large text, a paragraph is first provided for user comprehension, and then the quiz is generated based on it.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Users' submissions are recorded, and results are generated. A detailed analysis section allows users to review their performance and submissions. The sleek and user-friendly interface, is made with Streamlit which ensures a smooth and engaging user-experience.

## Problem Statement
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Our client, NewsSphere, is a leading news organization dedicated to expanding its global reach and enhancing audience engagement. With a vast amount of content published daily in multiple languages, the organization faces the considerable challenge of manually creating quizzes and
assessments for each article. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to inconsistencies across different languages and cultural contexts.

## Project Overview

1. **`User Input:`** User submits a news article in any language.

1. **`Language Detection:`** The app utilizes the Translation API to detect the language of the submitted content.

1. **`Translation to English:`** If the content is not in English, the app translates it into English using the Translation API.

1. **`Question Generation:`** The app calls the Gemini API to generate diverse and contextually relevant questions based on the input.
  
1. **`Translation Back:`** The generated questions are translated back into the original language of the news article using the Translation API.

1. **`Output:`** The app presents the questions in the original language to the user.
   
1. **`Quiz:`** User can now answer the various types of the questions generated.

1. **`Result:`** Once submitted âœ…, results are visible on the screen.
